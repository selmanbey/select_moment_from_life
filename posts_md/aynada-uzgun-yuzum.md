there were mirrors behind her bright red hair. she was sipping her coffee and talking about the gift she bought for her sister and I could not take my eyes on my exceptionally tanned face in the mirror. how did it get so tanned, i wondered. we don’t even get proper sun here. and oh god, do i not hate tan!

she talked and i talked and she talked and i tried to avoid the mirror and they kept catching my eye. in each new glimpse, my face got darker and uglier. in the end, it was a face nobody would ever find inspiring. why, i thought, why i have to be confronted with my own face in such a way at such a time.

my eyes, my own treacherous eyes got the hold of my tongue. i lost track of my grammar. my already patchy sentences started to get completely broken.

the mirrors just kept having in them my face. the mirrors just kept ruining my date.
