> From the soul's proper loneliness love and affection seem  
> part substance and part dream  
> held in the mouth in the same way the snake carries its eggs  
> if gripped too hard they break,  
> leaving a few grains of dust  
> and a heart crippled by its weight of lust.

![In Glasgow](https://payload.cargocollective.com/1/20/646881/10569910/wintercouple_1600_c.jpg)

In Glasgow, there was a moment. A moment in which I have felt that my life is complete. It was like what they call a religious experience.

_What is religious experience, she asks. She lies on the cushions. Cushions lie on the floor. The floor is full of visions. Visions of her pique turns. I don’t know, I say. I guess it’s a moment in which you feel that your life is complete. She lays down there. She has the most beautiful silence._

In that moment in Glasgow, we were sitting in a dark corner of a basement of a pub. The pub was called Nice’n’Sleazy. There was nothing sleazy about it that day. It was an open mic night and there were quite a number of talented musicians performing. One old guy broke into a song in between two performances with his naked, deep, touching voice.

_Do you feel old, she asks. She comes sit in the couch with her pijamas and her morning face. Takes two pictures of me with my camera. I look horrible in both of them. No, I say, I don’t feel old. I look at her. Slightly longer than a normal glance, but not long enough to make her feel awkward. She talks about his friend. How he got older and lost his crazy sides. She says she is glad that I still have them. I say I always thought myself as quite a stiff guy. She does not feel the need to say no, you are not. She is right. She does not need to._

In Glasgow, in that exact moment, my head on her shoulder, listening beautiful tunes, I have felt that my heart was not crippled by anything this time. This time it was experiencing a different kind of affection. A peaceful, quiet, not at all obsessed one. I was so full of love but also ready to let go. Very much aware of all the impossibilities surrounding me, but not bitter about them. I was satisfied with the serene pleasure of knowing that she is there, within a breath distance of me, and that she also enjoys being in my company.

That was the moment I have felt my life is complete.

It was a moment though.

A single one.
