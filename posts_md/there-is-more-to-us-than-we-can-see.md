i will say this is how the story unfolds. truth or otherwise, does it really matter?

> that night i got a message from her, saying “it was lovely” to see me and she find it “extremely easy” to be in my company.

so i say: god save us to be at the mercy of ourselves!

for we have a tendency to treat ourselves harshly. that’s also why having good friends is not a luxury, but a necessity: we need to see ourselves from the perspective of others now and then.

truly good friends let you to see yourself like they see you: an image formed with love and compassion, an image that you can not but be happy with —not preposterously shiny thus fake, but with many imperfections yet still beautiful. “see, that is the best of yourself” their friendship says, “that is who you really are”. and hearing that helps us to be better, helps us to move towards our very best.
