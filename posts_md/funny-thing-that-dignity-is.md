I passed through lust. Or, lust passed through me. Yes, thatâ€™s more like it.

Now I sit on the couch, wearing my half deserved pride, awake in the middle of night, listening [tunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2pRWFjtwio&feature=youtu.be) about thrill and its being gone. No shame I have, none, but maybe a wee bit sense of failure.

Pride does not always come in praiseworthy shapes.
