![Marble Eyes of Cicero](/img/post-img/blooming-buzzing-confusion.jpg)

Lucia arrived in a rainy night with feather steps. Standing on the door, waiting to be invited in with a big smile on her lips, she was just another ordinary human being. But when she started to talk, I saw flowers grew out of her orange hair. Her words splashed vivacious colors on the walls of my room. As she talked, candles shone even brighter and I almost heard the sound of the waves coming from that Van Gogh postcard. At the end of it all, when the music stopped, when the room succumbed into a white silence, I curled up in the couch and let it all sink. Deep and wide, it sinked. I fell asleep.

When I woke up, there was Verena. She must have glided through the door since I didn’t even know when she came. The wind whistled, the bottles are shattered, the police came. But we heard none of it. We heard the wisdom of old, leather-bounded books instead. Empty marble eyes of philosophers talked to us. Our friendship is forged by caramel flavoured coffees. The Irish sun, that rare, precious creature, stepped out of its den just to applaud our sincerity.

Thus passed the two days of my life, teaching me that time can extend and shrink, that there is still a lot of room in this world for hope.

For hope, for beauty, for solidarity, for humanity…

For myself
